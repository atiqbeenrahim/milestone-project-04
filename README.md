### Colours Used:

- Black (#000) was chosen as the background colour for the navbar and footer.

- Sky Blue (#87ceeb) was used for all buttons, discount banner and footer social media logos that are on the black background as it goes well with the hero image, as well as making a good contrast 
with the black background.

- White (#fff) was used as the backgorund, and black (#000) was used for the text on all pages other than the landing page so that the background and text do not detract from the products displayed.

- Balloon Blue (#2B60DE) was used for Logo of the website/company.

- [Django Crispy Forms](https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was used for all forms on the site.
- [Django Allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was used for user authentication on the site.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) was used to handle payments on the site.
- [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used to aid reponsive design.
- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) S3 was used to store all static CSS and Javascript files, and images.
- [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is the database that was used in production.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is the database used by the deployed site.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) hosts the Milestone Project 04 website.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) was used extensively throughout the site, in order to provide functionality for Bootstrap elements, and for Stripe. 
- [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) was used as an IDE for this project. 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) is where the Milestone Project 04's repository is stored. Regular commits were made throughout, and code was pushed to GitHub from GitPod.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for icons on the site.

## Information Architechture:

### Database Choice:

- SQLight was used in development, as it comes pre-installed with Django.
- PostgreSQL was used for the deployed site, as it is offered as an optional add-on by Heroku.

### Data Modeling:

- The image below was produced using the [dbdiagram.io](#https://dbdiagram.io/)

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/bbn9SVX/db-schema.png">

## Accessibility:

### Alt Tags:

In order to ensure that all images are accessible for those using a screen reader, I have ensured that all images used 
throughout the site include alt tags.

## Testing:

 - There are dead links on the footer on Social media Icons (Facebook, Instagram and Twitter).
 - There are no errors and warnings in the Developer console
 - The page is fully responsive and has been tested using the Developer console.

 #### Mobile:
  - Galaxy S5
  - Pixel 2
  - Pixel 2 XL
  - iPhone 4
  - iPhone 5 SE
  - iPhone 6, 7 and 8
  - iPhone 6, 7 and 8 Plus (real device)
  - iPhone X

#### Tablet:
  - iPad
  - iPad pro

#### Laptop:
  - Macbook

#### Browser:
  - Chome
  - Safari
  - Firefox
  - Opera
  - Microsoft Edge

### Known Bugs and Fixes:

- On the edit product form, as well as the add product form, it is possible to set the 'quantity in pack' field to 0 or a negative integer. 
This is not ideal, and poor UX, but will be fixed in due course when I have more time and knowledge.

- There is a small amount of overflow on the navbar dropdown menus on the right of the screen on the smallest screens.
This will be fixed when I have more time.

- All successful messages are displayed on the same toast. It seems strange to have messages about product updates
with shopping basket items below them. When I have more knowledge, I will decouple these messages, so that they 
display separately.

- When adding or editing a product, the newly selected image is not displayed on the add_product/edit_product pages.
This is poor UX, as even though it is displayed on the product-detail page after the form has been submitted, 
it leaves the user wondering whether their image has been uploaded or not. I will fix this when I have the knowledge 
to do so.

## Deployment:

### Heroku deployment with AWS:

- The FIT BEAST website was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using the following steps:

1. Install gunicorn, psycopg2-binary and dj-database-url using the ```PIP Install``` command.
2. Freeze all the requirements for the project into a requirements.txt file using the ```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt``` command.
3. Create a procfile, with the following inside it: ```web: gunicorn fit_beast.wsgi:application```.
4. Push these changes to GitHub, using ```git add .```, ```git commit -m``` and ```git push``` commands.
5. Navigate to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), and login or create an account.
6. Once logged in, click on 'resources'.
7. From the add-ons search bar, add the Heroku Postgres DB, select the free account, and then submit order form to add it to the project.
8. From the app's dashboard, click on 'settings', and then 'reveal config vars' in order to set the necessary configuration variables for the project. 
It should look like this: 

| Key                   | Value                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     | Your AWS Access Key        |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | Your AWS Secret Access Key |
| DATABASE_URL          | Your Database URL          |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS       | Your Email Password        |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER       | Your Email Address         |
| SECRET_KEY            | Your Secret Key            |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY     | Your Stripe Public Key     |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY     | Your Stripe Secret Key     |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET      | Your Stripe WH Key         |
| USE_AWS               | TRUE                       |

9. Back on the main dashboard, click on 'deploy', and then under the 'Deployment' method section, select GitHub and 'Automatic Deploys'.
10. Ensure that in settings.py, the following code is commented out:
```
Database
 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/settings/#databases
```
and the at the following code is added:
```
DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
```
11. Make migrations using the following command:
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
```
and migrate the database models to the Postgres database using the following command:
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```
12. Load the fixtures from the 'product_types.json' file and then from the 'products.json' file - which are contained in the 'fixtures' folder into the database. 
This is done by using the following command:
```
python3 manage.py loaddata <file name>
```
13. Create a new superuser with the following command:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
and then enter chosen email, username and password.
14. In settings.py, contain the previously entered database setting in an if statement, and add an else condition, so that different databases are 
used depending on the environment.
```
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }
```
15. Disable 'COLLECTSTATIC' with the fillowing code: ``` heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 ``` 
so that Heroku doesn't attempt to collect the static files.
16. Add ```ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['milestone-project-04.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']``` to settings.py.
17. Add Stripe environment variables to settings.py.
18. Push to Heroku using the following command:
```git push heroku main```

### Amazon Web Services:

All Static and media files for the deployed version of the site are hosted in a Amazon Web Services(AWS) S3 bucket. 
In order to create your own bucket, please follow the instructions on the AWS website 
[Here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html)

1. In the gitpod terminal, install boto3 and django-storages using the following commands:
```pip3 install boto3 ``` and ```pip3 install django-storages```
2. Freeze the new requirements into the 'requirements.txt' file using the ```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt``` command
3. Add 'storages' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py.
4. Add the following code to settings.py in order to link the AWS bucket to the website:
```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    # Cache control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }

    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'milestone-project-04'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-1'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

    # Static and media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```
5. Create a custom_storages.py file in the root level of the project. Inside it, include the locations of the Static Storage and Media Storage.
6. Delete DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC from the Heroku Config Variables.
7. Finally, push to GitHub, and all changes should be automatically pushed to Heroku too.

### Making a Local Clone:
In order to make a local clone of the FIT BEAST website, enter ```git clone https://github.com/atiqbeenrahim/milestone-project-04.git``` into the terminal. 


Next, create an .env.py file in the root directory of the project, and add it to the .gitignore file. 
The following code needs to be added to the .env.py file:
```
import os  
os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"    
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Secret Key>"
os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Public Key>"    
os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Secret Key>"    
os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "<Your Stripe WH Secret Key>"   
```

Then make sure that the required packages are installed by running the following command: 
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Make migrations and then migrate in order to create a database, by running the following commands:
```python3 manage.py makemigrations``` and ```python3 manage.py migrate```.

Load the fixtures from the 'product_types.json' file and then from the 'products.json' file - which are contained in the 'fixtures' folder into the database. 
This is done by using the following command:
```
    python3 manage.py loaddata <file name> 
```

Create a superuser with the following command: ```python3 manage.py runserver``` and entering your credentials.

Run the app by entering the following command:
```python3 manage.py runserver```
